# Laser-Tripwire
A Laser Tripwire Security System using Raspberry Pi.

## Abstract:
We have made a laser tripwire with Python and Raspberry Pi. This can be used as an easy-to-implement security system for our homes. The system uses a laser and LDR sensor. If the laser line is broken, the buzzer is sounded, a warning LED flashes and an alert is displayed. This is a cost effective security measure that can be applied by minimal requirements and a short snipper of code.

## Equipment Used:
* A Raspberry Pi (any model will do, but wiring may vary)
* A Laser Pointer
* A Breadboard
* Female-Male and Female-Female Jumper leads
* A Piezo Buzzer
* An LDR
* A LED
* A 1Î¼F Capacitor
